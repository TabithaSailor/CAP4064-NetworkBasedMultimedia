            <dt>Burpees</dt>
            <dd>Burpees are a great full body exercise to increase your strength and endurance. Begin in a standing position
              drop into a squat and extend your hands forward, kick your feet back and then forward again quickly, and then jump
              up from a squatted position.</dd>
            
            <dt>Planks</dt>
            <dd>Planks build your core strength. To perform a plank, get in a push up position and rest your forearms
                on the floor, hold the position as low as you can.</dd>

            <dt>Mountain Climbers</dt>
            <dd>Mountain climbers are good cardio exercises. Place your hands on the floor in a push up position, then bring
              one knee up to your chest and then switch as quickly as you can.</dd>
